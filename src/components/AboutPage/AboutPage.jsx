                                If you’ve ever worked on a long term project you know that its easy to lose track of small changes.
                                If you’re a songwriter you know it is especially difficult to keep track of all the small ideas that go into
                                a great song. Lyrics and the many recordings of your song will surely be in six different places and ultimately you
                                lose a great lyric you wrote one day. Or, worse yet, you’ve lost your bearings on your work and why you
                                wrote it in the first place.  <br /> <br />

                            My application solves these problems by creating a quick and centralized method
                            to organize song ideas at their inception while also keeping a working draft.  Add a name, a few lyrics and
                            a recording that captures the idea and you’re off!
